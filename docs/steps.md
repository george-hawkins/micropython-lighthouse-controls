<sub>It's not the neatest soldering job ever - the solder spread out surprisingly easily to adjacent holes and had to be tidied up.</sub>

<sub>And then bent into shape with a bending machine. This was all done at my local machine-tools center (the [Dynamo Machinenpark](https://www.dynamo.ch/maschinenpark)).</sub>

Wooden base and metal frame.
